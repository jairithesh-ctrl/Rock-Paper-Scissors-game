This is my second projet in python - ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME - USER VS COMPUTER
In this game there are special features such as you can choose the number of rounds you want to play vs the computer.
After you complete playing the number of rounds chosen by you the interface puts up the scoreboard of the user and computer showing who won the game by majority.
